## Project Description

The **3D Portfolio** is a web-based project designed to showcase a collection of 3D models and scenes. It allows users to interact with 3D objects, view them from various angles, and navigate through different projects. This portfolio highlights the creator's capabilities in 3D design, WebGL, and interactive web development.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models:** Users can rotate, zoom, and pan to explore models in detail.
- **Realistic Rendering:** Uses advanced lighting and shading techniques to create lifelike visuals.
- **Multiple Scenes:** Navigate through different 3D projects and environments.
- **Animations:** Support for animated models to demonstrate dynamic content.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy navigation and intuitive controls.

## Installation
